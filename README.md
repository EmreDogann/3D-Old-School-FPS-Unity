# 3D-Old-School-FPS-Unity

A experimental remake of Wolfenstein 3D to Unity which I tried to augment with:
- New weapon models, sounds, and animations
- Improved AI Pathfinding using A*
- Additional blood and gore effects

Goals for the future:
- Implementation of realtime destruction system similar to Rainbow Six Siege
- More advanced blood effects
- A weapon modification system
- A level construction system
